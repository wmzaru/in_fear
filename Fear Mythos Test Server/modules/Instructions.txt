2.Max Gems Given per DK of user - In this event, the users DKs are multipled by a default of 3 and the result is placed in gems on hand. The minimum gems this module will give is 1, regardless of multiplication.

3.All Buffs - The Myserty Buff gives 1 of 3 Buffs: Lightning Attack and Defence Buff, Regen Buff, Minion Buff. The settings allow admins to tweak and change to make these mroe rewarding or less rewarding at their whims.

IMPORTANT

4. Module Settings - These 3 are are defaulted to core downloaded forest specials. If you DO NOT have any of these 3 modules, please change the module name to another module. This was amde ajustable so that:
A)Servers that removed these specials could replace the nav easily, and 
B)Servers could change where they go to add more variety or challenge (for instance, a module that can only be found via the Cave)
