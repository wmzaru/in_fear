V 5.21+
This version adds a feature for players to go to their bio and identify where the location is for places
they have purchased maps for.  You MUST be able to go into the code of the module to find the location setting
and enter that in the correct place.  The default locations are listed above but are not input into the module.
You will have to do that manually.
