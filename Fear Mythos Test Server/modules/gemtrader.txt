Module: The Gem Trader (Village Special)
for Legend of the Green Dragon 1.x
Version 1.1 (09/28/06)
by Gary Hartzell

Description:
This module is my answer to LoGD games where there are players who love gem shops and others who 
hate them.  I personally don't like gem shops, but my players have too many gems on hand, and 
this module balances that out a little.

This is a village special where, if you have a gem, the Trader will offer you a random amount of 
gold for your gem.  The range of the offer is admin configurable, as well as the min and max 
levels the special is accessible, how many times a day the event can occur for a player, and the 
Trader's name.

Installation:
1. Upload to your LoGD modules directory
2. Log into LoGD, enter the Module Manager in the Superuser Grotto
3. Find "The Gem Trader" and click "Install"
4. From the next screen, again find "The Gem Trader" and click "Settings"
5. Choose your desired settings and save your changes
6. Click "Activate"
